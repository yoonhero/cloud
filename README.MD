# Future Technology Series

## #1 Cloud

Cloud Computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active managment by the user.

## Service Models

### Infrastructure as a service (laaS)

Infrastructure as a service refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to abstract various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup, etc.

### Platform as a service (PaaS)

PaaS vendors offer a development environment to application developers.

### SoftWare as a Service (SaaS)

In the software as service (SaaS) model, users gain access to application software and databases. 

### Mobile "backend" as a service (MBaaS)

In the mobile "backend" as a service (m) model, also known as backend as a service, web app and mobile app developers are provided with a way to link their applications to cloud storage and cloud computing services with application programming interfaces (APIs)

### Serverless computing or Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)

Serverless computing is a cloud computing code execution model in which the cloud provider fully manages starting and stopping virtual machines as necessary.



## Deployment models

### Private cloud 

<strong>I'll make this cloud</strong>

Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization.

### Public cloud 

Cloud services are considered "public" when they are delivered over the public Internet, and they may be offered as a paid subscription, or free of charge.
